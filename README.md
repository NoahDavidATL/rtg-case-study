# Project Manager Case Study

> Rooms To Go case study for Project Managers

1. Take a few moments to browse the current Rooms To Go [website](https://www.roomstogo.com)...
   - Find one thing you want to change.
   - Create a *User Story* and write up the *Acceptance Criteria*. You can include text, images, mockups, anything you want.
   - Estimate the *Story Points* you would give the story and explain your reasoning.

2. Your team begins work on the User Story and they are about 80% done with the change... 
   - An executive informs you that a new and very important requirement must now be included in the change; what are your teams options?
   - Which option would you most like to pursue in an ideal world?
   - Which option have you been forced to choose in previous jobs?

3. The sprint is almost over but your lead developer just informed you that they aren't going to complete the change in time...
   - How do you communicate this internally?
   - How do you communicate this externally?
   - What else (if anything) is part of your process at this point and/or moving forward?

4. (*Optional*) There may be multiple User Stories necessary to complete the change you envisioned, but we are only asking you to document **one** story. You can, of course, provide a bulleted list of any other stories you also would have created.


# Next Steps

- Email your completed document, PDF, powerpoint, etc to your contact at the company. We will be in touch to potentially schedule an in-person interview to meet the rest of the team. Thanks and good luck!
